    # --reasoning-parser and --tool-call-parser were mutually exclusive in
    # streaming mode (server.py bypassed the tool parser when reasoning parser
    # was active). 0.2.9 may have fixed this — re-enable cautiously after
    # verifying that streaming tool_calls still work for Qwen3-class models.
    # Without this flag, <think> blocks still appear in content text — most
    # consumers parse them from text as a fallback.
